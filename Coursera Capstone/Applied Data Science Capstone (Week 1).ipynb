    "I have been given the interesting task of helping them make data-driven decisions on the new locations that are most suitable for their new stores in Paris. This will be a main element of their decision-making process, the other being on the ground qualitative analysis of districts once when the report for this data is reviewed and studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fashion retailer is positioned in the upper end of the fast fashion market. Therefore, they only focus to high traffic areas where consumers go for shopping, restaurants and entertainment. Foursquare data will be very helpful in making data-driven decisions about the best of those areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Qualitative data from another retailer that they know, suggests that the best locations to open new fashion retail stores may not only be where other clothing is located. This data strongly suggests that the best places are in fact areas that are near French Restaurants, Caf√©s and Wine Bars. Parisians are very social people that frequent these places often, so opening new stores in these locations are becoming popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis and recommendations for new store locations will focus on general districts with these establishments, not on specific store addresses. Narrowing down the best district options derived from analysis allows for either further research to be conducted, advising agents of the chosen district, or on the ground searching for specific sites by the company's personnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without leveraging data to make decisions about new store locations, the company could spend countless hours walking around districts, consulting many real estate agents with their own district biases, and end up opening in yet another location that is not ideal.\n",

    "The data will provide better answers and better solutions to their task at hand."
